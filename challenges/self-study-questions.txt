1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

  forEach doesn't actually return anything. It iterates through the array and requires you to tell it what/how to return something. Map automatically iterates through the array and "maps" the asked-for values into a new array.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  A function is a piece of code with independent existence in the window, whereas a method is a function on a class with limited scope.

3. What is closure?

  An understanding of how scope works where variables and functions have to be declared in the same lexical environment to be used in other spaces.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

  1. Window Binding: the 'this' keyword refers to the entire JavaScript window unless told otherwise.

  2. Implicit Binding: Automatically binding the 'this' keyword to whatever is left of the dot when called

  3. Explicit Binding: Allows the programmer to decide what 'this' binds to by passing the reference into a function

  4. New Binding: Builds new objects using constructor functions, uses the 'this' keyword to assign key:value pairs.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

  super() is used to tell the child that the parent's attributes are necessary to the child's attributes.
